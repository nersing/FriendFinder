# FriendFinder

## Description

FriendFinder is an application that generates a "best friend" for the user based on their survey answers. This full-stack site will take in results from the users' survey of ten questions, then compares their answers with possible matches. The user's answers will range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The app will then display the name and picture of the best overall match.
